# BinBoot
Source code for BinBoot


This is the official source code for BinBoot, a tool that utilised leaked APIs from Bin Weevils.

Code provided is both the client and the server. Now that the game has officially died, the server code has been released. You can use this on a local Apache server
or a VPS for educational purposes, but the BW API will not work as their servers have been turned off.

Hereby I declare no responsiblity for anyone's actions henceforth from posting this source code. This is intended for educational and insightful purpose only.

installer.sh is the requirements installer for UNIX.
installer.bat is the requirements installer for Windows.

Halloween version is UNIX.
Win version is Windows.
